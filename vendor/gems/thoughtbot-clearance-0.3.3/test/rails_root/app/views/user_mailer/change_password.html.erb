Someone, hopefully you, has requested that we send you a link to change your password.

Here's the link:
<%= edit_user_password_url @user, :email => @user.email, :password => @user.crypted_password %>

If you didn't request this, no need to freak out, your password hasn't been changed.  You can just ignore this email.
