ValidatesAsEmail
================

This gem/plugin is a re-packaged and gem'ified version of the original plugin with credit as follows:

Ximon Eighteen <ximon.eighteen@int.greenpeace.org>
Dan Kubb <dan.kubb@autopilotmarketing.com>
Thijs van der Vossen <thijs@fngtps.com>

This Ruby on Rails plugin implements an ActiveRecord validation helper called
validates_as_email. The helper acts as if validates_format_of was used with a
regular expression that defines an RFC822 email address conformance test.

The plugin implements the regular expression here:

  http://tfletcher.com/lib/rfc822.rb

Which is an implementation in Ruby of a regular expression published by Cal
Henderson for PHP here:
